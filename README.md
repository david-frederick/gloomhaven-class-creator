# Gloomhaven Class Creator

This is a side-project I'm playing with casually. I'm persuing two goals: learning Javascript and VueJS; and creating an online tool to generate cards for the game Gloomhaven. This is [a decent example of what those cards look like](https://imgur.com/a/phrxy).

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
